## üî• Workflows

### üõéÔ∏è Daily Habblive Login

This project uses GitHub Actions scheduled workflow to keep your nickname alive. Every day at **03:00 (Bras√≠lia time)**, accounts added in `Secrets and Variables` will briefly log in to the Habblive client, keeping their accounts active and preventing them from being inactive for months and having their nicknames put up for sale. The workflow can be viewed [here](.github/workflows/login.yml).

### üÜô Persistent Login

This project uses GitHub Actions scheduled workflow to keep your active accounts indefinitely. In case of redirections or client outages, the accounts always re-enter automatically.
To configure the desired actions, access the code [here](persistent_login.py).

**NOTE:** Persistent Login is active for an average of 6 hours and must be reactivated after that period. If you want it to reactivate automatically, add the `HABILITAR_REINICIO` variable to the value `true` in `Settings` - `Secrets and Variables` - `Actions` - `Variables`.

Just make changes to the following snippet:

```py
# ===== CONFIGURA√á√ÉO =====
EXECUTAR_ACOES = True  # True = faz a√ß√µes no quarto, False = s√≥ loga/reloga (Cafofo ou Vista do Hotel)

# Configura√ß√µes personalizadas
DONO_QUARTO = "NICKNAME"    # Nome do dono do quarto.
NOME_QUARTO = "ROOM NAME"   # Nome exato do quarto.
# ========================
 ```
`EXECUTAR_ACOES` **True** = performs actions in the room, **False** = only logs in/logs back (Hotel Room or View);

`DONO_QUARTO` Name of the room owner **(If `EXECUTAR_ACOES` is true)**;

`NOME_QUARTO` Exact name of the room **(If `EXECUTAR_ACOES` is true)**.
